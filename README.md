The College Management System is a MERN Stack-based system with three different login portals for students, faculty, and admin.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Redux, TailwindCSS

I have used Vercel's VO for create UI components.
Also I have used Cursor code editor to optimize the code.

## Student Features

- External Marks: Access to view external marks for courses

## Setup

Add one admin using postman and then you can login into admin panel and add student and faculty from admin section.

1) Add Admin Credentials (I have added my credentials in the database, so you can directly run the project without adding admin credentials by doing admin login with login id as 806 and password as 0806).
 
2) Add Admin Details
